list of changes

-moved from kinematics2to3.h and.cpp to fourvector.h:
// Global functions for conversion 
// from ROOT 4vectors to strangecalc 4vectors.
template<typename T>
FourVector<T> operator*(const TLorentzRotation&, const FourVector<T>&);

FourVector<double> ToFourVector(const TLorentzVector&);
TLorentzVector ToLorentzVector(const FourVector<double>&);

-moved definitions of T0FourVector and ToLorentzVector from kinematics2to3.cpp to a new file FourVector.cpp

-commented out #include "2to3kinematics.h" in TDeuteron.cpp

-commented out all hash functions 
-commented out numtoa.h includes

-moved all the necessary wrapper classes in the dir with deuteron code, changed #include <> to #include ""

-commented out all includes of Structures.h as only defines of constants were needed

-included needed constants (STRANGEUFLOW, M_P, M_N) to my file constants.hpp (some  double definitions now of course)

-replaced all includes of Structures.h with #include "constants.hpp" (was not even needed in TYukawaPWF.cpp)

-changed TYukawaPWF to also include parmetrization with non-equidistant Mass(i) (AV18 f.i.)
  -added double *fM member
  -added fM(NULL) to initializer list of constructor
  -added new constructor with array of m values
  -check in constructor to delete fM when necessary
  -modified Mass(int i) for this case

-added AV18 and Av18b Deuteron wf to TDeuteron.h & TDeuteron.cpp

-added coordinate state wavefunction functions to TDeuteron
-some more vector types to DeuteronRState and DeuteronPState
-added off-shell momentum wave function parts to TWaveFunctionImplementation and derived classes
  (GetUpoff etc, DeuteronPStateOff functions...)


-commented out hash functions in TKinematics.cpp

-added hypron kin vars in TKinematics.cpp: updated constructors, getters, updatekinematics
-pklab: ++energycount changed naar ++anglecount
-l1250 added pklab kinematics

-added tan2 to Electronkin

-electronkinematics changed all 2to3 to 2to2

-added TKinematics2to3 to Tools, commented out functions that I moved previously...

-added masses to constructors to Tkinematics2to3(withlabangles)
changed setisospin function for masses functionality
