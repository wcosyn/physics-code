There are basically 2 different modules here


1) sampling routines
	
	
	Create "Events" (see event.hpp) by generating phase space in
	sampler.hpp and sampler.cpp. Extend it by including a phase
	space generating routine for example sampler_HALLA.cpp and 
	declaring generating function in sampler.hpp

	Events are outputted using EventParser declared in "parser.hpp"


2) c.m. momentum distr calculations
	
	
	In 2bodymom.cpp events are read in using EventParser in "parser.hpp"
	and calculations are performed for them.
